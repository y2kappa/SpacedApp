## Why
Because I forget stuff. Brain can keep this many things in memory at a time, but then it forgets. Things come to me, I write them down in "Keep" and then I never transfer them anywher. Also because I am paranoia about google knowing too much about me. Sometimes I remember something I used to know a long time ago and I realise how helpful they are. I want to wite down "notes" for every note. I want to swipe through them. I want this to be infrastructure for future new things, for example like "Principles" app for Ray Dalio.
